README for P4 compiler/interpreter

Included are the sources to the P4 Pascal -> P-code compiler and to the
P-code interpreter. The original source-code was written in Pascal, which
was transformed to C-code, using p2c.
(Details of the conversion can be found in the headers of the C-files)

You can redistribute all the source code freely, the p2c library source
and the code generated by it are NOT subject to the GNU general public
license. The original Pascal source-code is public domain.

Makefiles are included to compile the programs using gcc and Unix or
gcc (emx) and OS/2.
To make just enter: 
  make
or
  make -f makefile.os2
